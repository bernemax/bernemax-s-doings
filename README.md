## Topic: Garvers 6-node model

This repository serves as **training room**. 
New stuff will be added if progress is made.


## Content
* There is an existing "Model-base" which is about the so-called "Transmission extension problem".
* A little networt structure was taken from the Garvers 6 node structure (see picture below).
* Based on this, several models, aiming for different objectives, will be added.
