## Topic: IEEE 24 node system

This repository serves as **training room**. 
Two objectives are inplemented into the model:

**1) Total cost minimization**
- amount of investment into lines: xxx

**2) Investment-costs minimization**
- amount of investment into lines: xxx


## Content
* There is an existing "Model-base" which is about the so-called "Transmission extension problem".
* A little networt structure was taken from the IEEE 24 (test case system) node structure (see picture below).
* In this repository the option of node expansion with corresponding generators is included.
* The model solves a muliperiodic problem represented by 24 representative hours in a year (three years in total). The different total load in each hour is distributed due to the specific share of each node.
* The load changes with the corresponding year. 
* The model can decide in with hour t in wich year the best transmission and node expension plan/choise is done.
* Important remark: A building decision in period t in a sepcific year remains in the following periods and years.
