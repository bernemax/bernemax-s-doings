## Topic: Garvers 6-node model

This repository serves as **training room**. 
Two objectives are inplemented into the model:

**1) Total cost minimization**
- amount of investment into lines: 198 

**2) Investment-costs minimization**
- amount of investment into lines: 140


## Content
* There is an existing "Model-base" which is about the so-called "Transmission extension problem".
* A little networt structure was taken from the Garvers 6 node structure (see picture below).
* Based on this, several models, aiming for different objectives, will be added.
